				<p>
					The security alarm sensor's flow chart logic was implemented in simplified block code through user friendly software called nanoNavigator using a programmable logic controller (PLC). The main goal of the project was to create a device which can detect movement, detect potentially dangerous objects and inform the user when any of the above situations may occur.

					Inputs peripherals:<br>
					I-00: Diffused photoelectric sensor<br>
					I-02: Inductive Sensor<br>
					I-03: Push Button <br><br>
					Output peripherals:<br>
					Q-00: Blue light<br>
					Q-01: Orange light<br>
					Q-02: Buzzer<br><br><br>

					The security alarm sensor's outer case was designed on SolidWorks. Scroll down to see the sketch as well as the block code implemented on nanoNavigator.
